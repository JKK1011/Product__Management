# Product Management System

Welcome to our Product Management System! This project is designed to help businesses efficiently manage their products and provide users with a seamless experience. Below, we'll provide an overview of the functionalities, technologies used, and how to run the project.

## Functionalities

### User Roles
- **User**: Users have complete control over product data, including adding, editing, and deleting products as necessary. They can also view product details and manage their account information.

### Product Management
- **User Control**: Users have complete control over product data, including adding, editing, and deleting products as necessary.
- **Flexible Data Adjustment**: Users can modify all aspects of a product, such as its name, description, price, and other details, to ensure accurate representation.
- **Automatic Update**: Any changes made to product information are instantly reflected in the system, guaranteeing real-time accuracy and consistency.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: The backend of the application is built using Spring Boot, providing a powerful and streamlined framework for building Java-based applications.
- **Hibernate**: Hibernate is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to facilitate interaction with the database.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The frontend interface is developed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
- **Spring Security**: Spring Security is used for secure authentication and authorization.
- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL is used as the relational database management system to store information about products, users, and orders.

## Additional Notes

- Implement proper validation for user inputs.
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
- Enhance the UI/UX for better user experience.
- Implement pagination for product lists if dealing with a large number of records.
- Implement functionalities for tracking order history.
- Implement functionalities for managing user roles and permissions.

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running on your machine.
4. Set up the database by running the SQL scripts provided in the project.
5. Configure the database connection properties in the `application.properties` file.
6. Build the project using Maven or your preferred build tool.
7. Run the Spring Boot application.
8. Open your web browser and navigate to the specified localhost port to access the application.

## Conclusion

Our Product Management System provides a user-friendly interface for users to efficiently manage products. With features like comprehensive product management, real-time updates, and user-friendly design, this system aims to streamline business operations and enhance the user experience. Built with Spring Boot, Hibernate, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL, it offers a robust and scalable solution for businesses of all sizes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
